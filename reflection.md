What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would suggest that the person go to OHs, and if it overlaps with their schedule, then schedule 1:1 appointments with the professors. It can be overwhelming to start, but it's better to do the assignments gradually so that we notice more errors at different times.
